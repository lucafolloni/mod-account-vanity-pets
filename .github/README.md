## mod-account-vanity-pets

The module's objective is to go through the list of characters on an account (which is activated when the player enters the server, with OnLogin), obtain the playerGuids and store the vanity pets spells that all the characters know. Then, said list is run through, and the character who does not know the spell is taught said spell.
